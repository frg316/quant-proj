# Quant-Project
A project for helping making financial decisions

##Update: Added article stream for tickers.  When tickers are inputted, the application calls the NY Times API to grab articles from the end date entered to two weeks before it.  The articles are clickable links that will bring the user straight to the NY Times page.  Currently working on moving average lines, regression line is fully functional for display with r2 value.
